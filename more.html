          Capsule
        </dt>
        <dd>
          An actor-like software construct defined in Panini which
          <ul>
            <li>uniquely owns its state variables,</li>
            <li>provides a set of procedures which can be invoked, and</li>

          Capsule, Child
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A capsule declared within the definition of another capsule. Note that
          each design argument of some capsule C is not counted as a child
          capsule of C (though they may well be child capsules of some other
          capsule).

          Capsule, Leaf
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A capsule having no children. A leaf capsule may be either passive or
          active.

        </dt>
        <dd>
          A capsule having a user-defined <code>run()</code> declaration.

        <dt>
          Capsule, Root
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A capsule which is active and has no dependencies. Usually designated
          with the <code>@Root</code> annotation.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Declaration, <code>design()</code>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Where the user defines the set of design arguments and specifies what
          capsules are to be wired to it’s child capsules.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Declaration, <code>init()</code>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Where the user defines initialization code for a capsule’s state variables.

        <dt>
          Declaration, <code>run()</code>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Where the user defines custom run behavior for a capsule. If a capsule
          has a run declaration, it is called an active capsule. Otherwise, it
          is called a passive capsule.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Capsule Requirements
        </dt>
        <dd>

          C to be well-defined.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Execution Profile
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The mechanism or policy by which a capsule’s procedure invocations are
          processed. For example, in the case of the thread execution profile,
          procedure invocations are submitted to a queue and processed
          one-by-one by that capsule’s own dedicated thread.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Future
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A thread-safe object/class which represents a result of a task. We say
          that a future is resolved when the task is complete and the result is
          ready to be used. If a thread tries to use this result before it has
          been resolved, then the thread will block until it is resolved.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Duck Future
        </dt>
        <dd>
          An object/class which is a mockup of one of the user’s objects/classes
          but also acts as a future, resolvable by the panini runtime.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Method
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A regular Java method. (This is distinct from the Panini concept of a
          procedure.)
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Method Call
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A regular call to a Java method. (This is distinct from the Panini
          concept of procedure invocation.)
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Oracle
        </dt>
        <dd>
          When testing whether some computation has computed some result
          correctly, an oracle can be queried for the result which that
          computation should have computed.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Panini
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The abstract programming model which defines the semantics of a system
          of interacting capsules.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          PaniniJ
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A research language similar to Java which adds support for the
          capsule-oriented programming as defined in the Panini programming
          model.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          @PaniniJ
        </dt>
        <dd>
          An annotation processor for writing Panini programs in Java.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Procedure
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A panini analog of a method. A procedure is the user-defined code on a
          capsule’s interface which can be invoked (i.e. called), potentially by
          other capsules or other threads. Arguments can be passed and an object
          can be returned. Importantly, the returned object can be a duck
          future.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Procedure Invocation
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A panini analog of a method call. (See Procedure.)
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Shape
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A description of a method’s return and argument types. This is
          essentially the information in a method signature aside from its
          names. By extension, we also say that procedures have shape.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Signature
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A Panini analog of a Java interface. Each signature specifies a set of
          procedures. In order for a capsule to implement a signature, it must
          have a definition matching the shape and name of each procedure in
          that signature.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          State Variable, also state
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A Panini analog of an instance variable on a Java object. A state
          variable is a variable attached to a capsule instance. They can only
          be accessed and modified by the init() declaration and procedures of
          the capsule which owns them.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          System Topology
        </dt>
        <dd>
          How a network of capsules is connected.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Template Class
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A Java class annotated with either <code>@Capsule</code> or
          <code>@Signature</code> which specifies the elements of a capsule or
          signature, respectively. For example, some elements which a capsule
          template class is used to define are the procedure definitions, the
          <code>define()</code> declaration, and child capsule declarations. It
          is from processing a set of template classes that @PaniniJ generates a
          set of source artifacts.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Wiring
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The process of initializing a system of capsules with references to
          one another according to the user-defined system topology.
        </dd>
