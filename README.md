A realization of Panini via a Java compiler plugin. Panini is a capsule-oriented programming model, which introduces a new programming abstraction, *the capsule*. The main motivation behind this abstraction is to enable more modular reasoning about concurrent programs.

See http://hridesh.github.io/panini for basic usage and documentation.
