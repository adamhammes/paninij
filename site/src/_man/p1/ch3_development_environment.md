This documentation has not yet been written. For now, to find out how to set up
your development environment with @PaniniJ, you may want to take a look at the
following:

- [The Eclipse Setup Guide](https://paninij.github.io/setups/eclipse.html)
- [Chapter 2](/man/p1/ch2_getting_started.html) of the manual if you are
  building and running from the command line with `javac` and `java`.
- Otherwise, the [@PaniniJ Setup Examples Repo](https://github.com/paninij/paninij-setup-examples)
  for some guidance getting started with other configurations (e.g. IntelliJ,
  Maven, Ant, and Gradle).
