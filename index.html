      <p> Existing concurrent programming practices leave practitioners
          with no choice but to program using unbridled concurrency mechanisms,
          and then find and remove concurrency errors.
          We, Panini project team members, believe that this path is untenable.
          The Panini project investigates an alternative: create programming abstractions
          that eliminate classes of concurrency errrors by construction.
          Our work focusses on an abstraction called a capsule, a boundary
          within which you can write and reuse sequential code as is.
          The research portion of the Panini project team works on increasing
          the class of concurrency errors that can be eliminated from
          capsule-oriented programs by construction.

        @PaniniJ is an implementation of the
        <a href='http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~panini/papers.shtml'>Panini
        programming model</a> that enables the use of standard Java tools for
        capsule-oriented programming. The Panini model is a set of rules that
        eliminates certain classes of errors that are common in explicit
        concurrent programs.
      </p>

      <P>
       @PaniniJ utilizes annotation processing, a standard method of hooking
       into the Java compiler, to generate concurrent code based on templates
       created by the user. By converting the keywords of the PaniniJ language
       into annotations, we are able to enforce the Panini model while still
       allowing users to utilize any java tools they want. This Manual is for
       getting started with @PaniniJ in the
       <a href='https://eclipse.org/'>Eclipse</a> IDE.
